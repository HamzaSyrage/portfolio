        I have experience developing Front-End web, from simple landing pages to
        progressive web applications. I strive to create software that not only
        functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive,
        pixel-perfect user experiences. I love learning new and better ways to
        create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable
        code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for
        opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their
        knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary
        goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the
        best in me.
